# Tranhelm [DEP]
Lunar environment multi-agent simulator

Tarnhelm consists of a simple simulator which takes in a heightmap [0,255] and a resource map [0,1] which indicate the level of resources burried in the given pixel.

The aim of the game is for the system of cooperative rovers to accumulate and process as many resources as possible.

Development halted and the repo will no longer be maintained or worked on.
